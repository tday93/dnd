Staff of Frost
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or
wizard)*

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can
use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the
following spells from it, using your
spell save DC: :ref:`srd:cone-of-cold` (5 charges), :ref:`srd:fog-cloud` (1 charge), :ref:`srd:ice-storm` (4 charges), or :ref:`srd:wall-of-ice` (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is
destroyed.
