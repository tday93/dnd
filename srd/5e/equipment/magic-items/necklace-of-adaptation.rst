Necklace of Adaptation
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any
environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against
harmful gases and vapors (such as :ref:`srd:cloudkill` and :ref:`srd:stinking-cloud`
effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
