Apparatus of the Crab
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary*

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500
pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch
unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller
creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,
each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain
levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following
statistics:

**Armor Class**: 20

**Hit Points:** 200

**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail
aren't extended)

**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the
apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.
The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by
the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of
900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per
minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two
of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as
shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.
