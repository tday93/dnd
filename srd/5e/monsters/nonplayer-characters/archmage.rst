Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to
the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens,
while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are
neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice
their magic without interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage
interlopers.
