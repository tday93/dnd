Diseased Giant Rats
-------------------

Some giant rats carry vile diseases that they spread with their bites. A
diseased giant rat has a challenge rating of 1/8 (25 XP) and the
following action instead of its normal bite attack.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease.
Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by
magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6)
every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result
of this disease, the target dies.
