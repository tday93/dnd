grappling a creature, the rug takes only half the damage dealt to it,
and the creature :ref:`srd:grappled` by the rug takes the other half.

**Smother**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium
or smaller creature. *Hit*: The creature is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13).
Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, :ref:`srd:blinded`, and at risk
of suffocating, and the rug can't smother another target. In addition,
at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 10 (2d6 +
3) bludgeoning damage.
