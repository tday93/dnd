Challenge
---------

    A monster's **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the
    monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four
    adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge
    rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example,
    a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a
    challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly
    one.

    Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters
    have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge
    rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no
    effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that
    have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

    Some monsters present a greater challenge than
    even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a
    challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to
    test player skill.

Experience Points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on
    its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the
    monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the
    threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

    Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell
    or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.
