Hypnotic Pattern
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial
filled with phosphorescent material)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air
inside a 30 foot :ref:`srd:cube` within range. The pattern appears for a moment and
vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes :ref:`srd:charmed` for
the duration. While :ref:`srd:charmed` by this spell, the creature is :ref:`srd:incapacitated`
and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if
someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
