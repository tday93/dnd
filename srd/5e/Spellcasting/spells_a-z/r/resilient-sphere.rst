Resilient Sphere
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a
matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A :ref:`srd:sphere` of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size
or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the
duration.

Nothing---not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects---can pass
through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the :ref:`srd:sphere` can
breathe there. The :ref:`srd:sphere` is immune to all damage, and a creature or
object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the :ref:`srd:sphere` damage anything outside
it.

The :ref:`srd:sphere` is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature
or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push
against the :ref:`sphere's <srd:sphere>` walls and thus roll the :ref:`srd:sphere` at up to half the
creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by
other creatures.

A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming
anything inside it.
