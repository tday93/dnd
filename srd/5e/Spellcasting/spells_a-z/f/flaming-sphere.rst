Flaming Sphere
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a
dusting of powdered iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5 foot diameter :ref:`srd:sphere` of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your
choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends
its turn within 5 feet of the :ref:`srd:sphere` must make a Dexterity saving throw.
The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the :ref:`srd:sphere` up to 30 feet. If you ram the
:ref:`srd:sphere` into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against
the :ref:`srd:sphere`'s damage, and the :ref:`srd:sphere` stops moving this turn.

When you move the :ref:`srd:sphere`, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet
tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The :ref:`srd:sphere` ignites
flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light
in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
2nd.
