Silence
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level illusion (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20
foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a point you choose within range. Any
creature or object entirely inside the :ref:`srd:sphere` is immune to thunder
damage, and creatures are :ref:`srd:deafened` while entirely inside it. Casting a
spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
