    Certain spells created by well-known wizards have more generic names in the
    `5e SRD <http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf>`_. Others
    were not included at all (so we can't list them here).
    
    If you can't find what you're looking for, try removing the inventor's name.
